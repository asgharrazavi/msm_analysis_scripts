# Comments

`ionized.psf` and `ionized.psf` are used to start all of the MD simulations in 4 stages. 
`protein.pdb` contains only the protein (Opsin) structure.
Only the protein structures are shown in the `stage2_xtcs` and `stage4_xtcs` simulation trajectories due to large file sizes.
Frames are saved every *400* ps. 
The **stage1** and **stage2** simulations are not here because of large file sizes as well. These simulations are archived and are available upon request.
