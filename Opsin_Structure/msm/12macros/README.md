First we use the `pccaplus.py` script to kinetically map microstates to macrostates.
Then we use `micro_to_macro.py` to convert micro assignmnets to macro assignments. 
Finally we use `tpt.py` to obtain transition paths and fluxes.

To identify which macrostates are _sink_ and which are _source_ in the `tpt.py`
script, we can use the `extract_frames2.py` script to extract frames from each macrostates and visualize them.
