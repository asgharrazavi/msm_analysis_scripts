# Workflow
step1: use `implied_times2.py` to calculate MSM implied timescales for a series of MSM lag-times.
<br />  
step2: choose a proper MSM lag-time and use `opsin_msm.py` to get MSM eigenvalues, eigenvectors, transition probability matrix, etc.
<br />  


# Comments

**msm lagtime: 40 ns**

MSM could be build on a _macrostate_ level for better visualization of 
metastable states and transitions among them and obtaining flux values that capture conformational
transitions in a dynamics system. See `12macros` folder for _macro-level_ MSM for the Opsin.
