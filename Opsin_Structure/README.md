### Comments

The tICA parameteres and tICA reaction coordinates are calculated in the `tica_files` folder.
</br >
The Markov State Model (MSM) in microstate and macrostate levels are constructed at `msm` folder.

</br >
The `md_files` folder contain some raw molecular dynamics simulation trajectories and `pdb` and `psf` files to visualize them.
