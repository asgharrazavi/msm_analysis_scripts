# Comments
Some of the `on_tica_l20_??.h5` files are not here because of large sizes. 
<br />  
These files are generated using the `../project_on_tica_simple.py`
<br />  
The files: `ev0.h5`  and  `ev1.h5`  are projection of all of the MD simulation data on tICA *1st* and *2nd* eigenvectors.
<br />  
`tic_cont_zoom.png` and `tic_cont_all.png` show contribution of each tICA eigenvector to total dynamics captured by tICA. These contributions are normalized and accumulated.
