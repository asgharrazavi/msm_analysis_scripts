Each `tar` filed contains 50 `txt` files, one for each MD trajectory. 
These parameters are used for building tICA.
</br >

These files are generated using the `tcl` scripts on my `NAMD-VMD-Tcl` GitHub repository.

`img_dataset.png` shows distrubution of each parameter over the entire ensemble of MD simulations.

`img_pot_prob.png` shows probability of finding a potassium ion within certain distance from Na2 site.
