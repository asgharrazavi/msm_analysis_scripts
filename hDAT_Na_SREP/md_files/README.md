`ionized.pdb` and `ionized.psf` are the simulated starting point for the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) system.
</br >

The molecular dynamics simulation trajectory files: `prot_dop_ions_*.xtc` contain only the protein and bound dopamine and ions. These files can be visualized by using `prot_dop_ions.pdb`.
</br >

The `analysis` folder contains all the input files for building tICA.
Each `tar` filed contains 50 `txt` files, one for each MD trajectory.
